Through my self-portraits, I aim to capture the essence of my own being and reflect on my own journey through time. Each photograph is a reflection of my own experiences and emotions. Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

    "text": "arXiv Preprint | Code\nOver the centuries, I have devoted countless hours to deciphering and translating the ancient scripts and dialects of the various peoples of Middle-earth. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

With a mathematical background and hands-on experience in machine learning and data science, I’ve had the opportunity to work on various projects, including brain segmentation research using PyTorch and analyzing NFL injury patterns through data analysis.\nMy technical skills span shell scripting, R, Python, SQL, and Java, with emerging expertise in PyTorch and scikit-learn. I’ve applied these skills in various roles, from a Machine Learning Research Assistant position through Emory University’s Woodruff School of Nursing to a Data Science Internship at Flock Specialty Finance, where I processed and modeled over a million data entries.\nAs a QuestBridge Scholar and HSF 2024 STEM Summit Scholar, I’m committed to advocating for diverse perspectives in tech and continuous learning. I’m eager to connect with professionals in data science, machine learning, and data engineering to explore how we can bring much needed diverse perspectives into the world of analytics and machine learning.\nOn this website, you will find a selection of my projects. You will also find a blog where I publish news, updates, and anything I find interesting in the world of data. I intend to make this a place where I can share my journey in data and showcase my work in a portfolio.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
