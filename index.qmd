# Hi, I am Alix Morales!


Alix is a senior majoring in applied math and statistics. As a former athlete, he developed a passion for sports statistics, which led him down the path of data science. He is passionate about machine learning, AI, and its legal implications. From his experience creating mathematical models to drive smarter financial investments to his experience assisting in the classroom, he counts on a deep understanding of data science principles. 

As a data science intern at Flock Specialty Finance, he utilized mathematical models to enhance the evaluation of potential investment portfolios. Following this experience, he drafted a quantitative report on NFL injury data, alongside a peer and a professor from Emory University, identifying potential factors that affect injury rates. Since then, he has partnered with a researcher at Emory University to work on an entry for a machine learning brain segmentation challenge, utilizing packages such as Monai and scikit-learn.

As a teaching assistant for Emory University’s data science computing course, he developed the ability to break down fundamental data science and computing principles for students. Currently, he serves as a data analytics intern at The Carter Center, where he works on identifying potential use cases for large language models in legal analysis. On campus, Alix is a member of Emory’s Questbridge Scholar Network and an executive board member for Emory Black and Latin in STEM (BLIS). Alix enjoys spending time outdoors and strumming his guitar in his free time. Specifically, he enjoys playing baseball on the Emory Club Baseball team and roaming through the woods.
